    "# Capstone 3 - Customer Churn Prediction for Telco\n",
    "\n",
    "Customers at Telco are very important. Anytime a customer decides to leave, it is vital to understand the reason for why they left. Some customer churn is inevitable: a customer moves away from the area, for example. For any other churn, we need to be able to identify why it happens, and look to create solutions to avoid this in the future. Without customers, our company doesn't exist. \n",

    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We analysed data from the [Telco Data Set](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/businessanalytics/blogs/steven-macko/2019/07/11/telco-customer-churn-1113), where we analyzed data from Q3 of our customers, including demographics, location, and billing/services information. Within the data sets listed, which included:\n",

    "* TELCO customer services\n",
    "* TELCO customer population\n",

    "Of the two main reason for customers leaving, attitude of support or service is a fix that is within the control internally of our company. I will leave judgement of how to fix this with the directors that lead these departments. One observation I would make that is worth noting, however, is that customers with no tech support within their services tended to churn much more often than those with the service. It could be benefitial to consider ways to make the service more available to help retain customers. We will see this supported in the graphics below:\n",
