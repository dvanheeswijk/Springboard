    "# Capstone 3 - Customer Churn Prediction for Telco\n",
    "\n",
    "Customers at Telco are very important. Anytime a customer decides to leave, it is vital to understand the reason for why they left. Some customer churn is inevitable: a customer moves away from the area, for example. For any other churn, we need to be able to identify why it happens, and look to create solutions to avoid this in the future. Without customers, our company doesn't exist. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We analysed data from the [Telco Data Set](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/businessanalytics/blogs/steven-macko/2019/07/11/telco-customer-churn-1113), where we analyzed data from Q3 of our customers, including demographics, location, and billing/services information. Within the data sets listed, which included:\n",

    "\n",
    "After cleaning the data and organizing it as shown above, we dived in to see if we could find any possible explanations for customers leaving. From this, we were able to identify a few trends that give us areas to improve our services. Overall, our customers left generally due to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Competitor Offers**\n",
    "* **Attitude of customer service**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is displayed below in the analysis of churn reasons given by our customers that left:\n",

   "cell_type": "markdown",

   "source": [
    "Of the two main reason for customers leaving, attitude of support or service is a fix that is within the control internally of our company. I will leave judgement of how to fix this with the directors that lead these departments. One observation I would make that is worth noting, however, is that customers with no tech support within their services tended to churn much more often than those with the service. It could be benefitial to consider ways to make the service more available to help retain customers. We will see this supported in the graphics below:\n",

    "\n",
    "One area I'd like to highlight is the internet services. We see that customers with **Fiber Optics tended to churn at nearly double the rate of those without the service**. This could lead to our other major churn reason: *Competitor Offers*\n",
    "\n",
    "If we do some additional research, we would likely find that areas that were offered Fiber Optics deals by competitors correspond to the customers that left. This leads to our next way of analysing the data available, based on location of customers. Before we look at the graphs, we should note that there are many small areas that had high churn rates, but relatively low customer totals. Most customers that left were from larger areas where we had more customers overall. We see, however, that a few regions have higher percentages of customer churn.\n",

This is in comparison to Los Angeles and San Diego, the two cities with the most total customer churn, that saw roughly 30% customer turnover. It would be worth looking into whether there are competitors in these cities that are adding to the turnover rates."

    "We are now nearly ready to create our train and test split. Before we do this, though, our first major observation is that we have a very small dataset to work with (at just 7032 total entries). This means that we have to consider using fewer features as a result.\n",

    "* Contract_Month-to-month\t\n",
    "* Contract_Two year\t\n",
    "* Payment Method_Electronic check\n",
    "\n",
    "The features that correspond to the contract type and tenure in months makes sense in regards to whether a customer may leave or not. If a customer is on a month to month contract, they likely will be less inclined to stay if a better offer comes around. When it comes to tenure, customers likely feel more loyal to the company the longer they are with the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for Fiber Optic services, we saw above that customers with fiber optics were likely to churn at nearly 40%, wheras all other customers in regards to their internet services were likely to churn a rate of less than 20%. We, therefore, would expect this feature to be a part of our models."

We saw in our exploration of the data that the customers that did not have Online Backup, Online Protection, or other technical support services were significantly more likely to churn. The solution could be as simple as automatically making these services available to customers, through a longer contract for equal or very slight difference in price. While it may not be feasible to give these away to every customer, it is clear that, without these services, our customers tend to become frustrated with our support service, particularly when the must call in for customer support.
