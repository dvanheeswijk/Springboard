    "Our club, **Team FC**, is competing in the top division of England. Our survival within the league relies on many facets, including elite performance on the pitch by the first team players, expert coaching from our coaching staff, and quality recruitment to continue to make the club competitive.\n",

    "As the club's data scientist, I am in charge of improving our club by using the data available to create systems that accomplish these goals. The purpose of this report is to address the recruitment phase of our club.\n",

    "### Goal for recruitment\n",
    "\n",
    "Our recruitment policy as a club is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Purchases for players should be limited to players below the age of 26 years old\n",
    "* Transfer budget is 40 million\n",
    "* At most 1 player can be bought that is not European\n",

    "Many of these features were gathered directly from the data sets, with the exception of a few, such as age, region, and league level. For each of these, we combined data from at least two data sets. For example, age was found by combining the year gathered from Date of Birth (in dict_players) and subtracting from season to get the age for a player in a given season.\n",
    "\n",
    "We combined the data all by grouping the data from the transfers data set by season and player id, then concatenating the data from our other sets, either by both season and player id in the case of stats, or just player id from dict.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we consolidated positions, regions and league levels from the data by combining entries into groups. For example, our data gives the player's nationality. We then converted the nationality code (a 3 letter code used by [FIFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_FIFA_country_codes)) to the continent that the nation is a member of within FIFA, by scaping the individual federation lists of nationalities and converting the nation to the continent.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to deal with null or missing values, we searched through each column with null values and made decisions to remove when the missing data was not significant or find the accurate values if they could easily be found online (mainly for nationalities of individual players). Our largest set of null values actually comes from the market value column, with nearly half of the values in the data set missing. Because we are trying to predict that value with our model, we decided to separate the data with missing market value and then apply the model to this data, giving us a good test set of data for our final model."

That is very young, which means that the clubs in the league must be selling their wide players early on.\n",

If we are looking for an elite player, the Italian league is likely to have younger players available for purchase, while the English and Spanish leagues will be more expensive no matter the position. It should be noted that English goalkeepers are significantly lower value than the other two leagues, meaning that goalkeepers in the league may be more affordable with the higher intensity of experience."
