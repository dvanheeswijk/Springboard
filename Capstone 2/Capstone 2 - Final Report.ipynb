    "Many of these features were gathered directly from the data sets, with the exception of a few, such as age, region, and league level. For each of these, we combined data from at least two data sets. For example, age was found by combining the year gathered from Date of Birth (in dict_players) and subtracting from season to get the age for a player in a given season.\n",

    "We combined the data all by grouping the data from the transfers data set by season and player id, then concatenating the data from our other sets, either by both season and player id in the case of stats, or just player id from dict.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we consolidated positions, regions and league levels from the data by combining entries into groups. For example, our data gives the player's nationality. We then converted the nationality code (a 3 letter code used by [FIFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_FIFA_country_codes)) to the continent that the nation is a member of within FIFA, by scaping the individual federation lists of nationalities and converting the nation to the continent.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to deal with null or missing values, we searched through each column with null values and made decisions to remove when the missing data was not significant or find the accurate values if they could easily be found online (mainly for nationalities of individual players). Our largest set of null values actually comes from the market value column, with nearly half of the values in the data set missing. Because we are trying to predict that value with our model, we decided to separate the data with missing market value and then apply the model to this data, giving us a good test set of data for our final model."

We see in the following graphic that the model values are less than the actual recorded until 30, then the two are much closer. However, the general trend is the same and we can see that our model shows that the prices of players starts to rise heavily at 19 or 20 years old. This means that, of the young players that we could target, the best value will come from players aged  at most 20.\n",

    "Despite this, we can see clearly that our best bet for recruiting below market average players comes from Tier 3, the Dutch, Belgian, and Turkish leagues.

As we can see, the model predicts that RM's in 2018 are roughly 2,000,000 more valuable than the actual data shows. This is in contrast to all other positions, which are within 1 million. Our thoughts are that the model is missing some important feature specific to these positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, our assessment is that RMs and CAMs give the best value in sales, while purchasing GKs, CDMs, and RBs may provide the best value in terms of bargains. Thus, finding right defenders that have potential to be converted to right wingers and central defensive midfielders that can be converted to attacking midfielders would ultimately produce the most bargain and highest sales in combination. Our scouts should focus on attacking minded CDMs and RBs. \n",

We also see that South American players tend to be the highest overall average value. We see, then, that achieving value for cost for South American players would be significantly harder. There are many well documented occurrences of players not quite playing to the price tag, which is not a risk we can take.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, I recommend that we target players from North America and Africa. The model and actual values show that players from these regions are similar to Europeans in value, but there is a greater range of possible error, meaning that players can often be undervalued or overvalued. If the player turns out to be not to standard, we won't lose as much money from the transfers as we would buying South American players. Asian players tend to be the lowest value, which may make the sales of such players not profitable in the long run, unless the player plays well above their market value.\n",
